A text-based minesweeper clone.

This is a simple minesweeper clone written in C++.

This project was a challenge to write a minesweeper clone, and do it without using good object oriented practices.

I did it this way as an experiment to see how difficult such software is to maintain.

The code itself is a good example of how I write code in C++, with exception of the fact that this program's architecture
isn't based on good object oriented design.

Usage:

   When entering coordinates, the upper left hand corner is 0,0.
